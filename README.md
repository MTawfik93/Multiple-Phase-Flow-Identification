## Abstract

  The Identification of gas-solid flow characterization in dense-phase pneumatic conveying particles is very important to a vast area of industrial fields such as chemical and pharmaceutical industries since a slight change in flow characteristics results in a completely different product. The motion of the gas-solid two phase flow in dense-phase usually has a nonlinear and unsteady nature that needs to be examined and analyzed to identify the particle flow behavior in the pneumatic conveying pipelines. In this research a method to identify this kind of flow regimes is proposed using a computational method where a gravity flow rig is modelled on Solidworks and multiple flow patterns are simulated with different particle sizes ranging between 0.5 to 3 millimeters plastic beads. For changing the flow patterns inside the pipe, an Iris Mechanism is designed according to the specifications of the flow required to achieve the flow pattern control. A sectioning method is implemented to capture tomographic sections for different flow patterns. Afterwards images is fed to a Convolutional Neural Network which is trained to identify the flow patterns according to several flow features. A GUI is designed to better visualize the whole system and vew the determined flow pattern.
